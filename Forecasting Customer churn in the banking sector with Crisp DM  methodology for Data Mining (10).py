# Correlation Matrix is performed to identify the correlation between each feature and the target variable 'Exited'.It calculates the correlation between each column in churn_data1 and the 'Exited' column. The height of each bar represents the strength and direction of the correlation between that specific column and the 'Exited' variable.
# 
# A positive correlation coefficient close to 1 indicates that as the values of the column increases, the chance for the customer 'Exiting' also increases, which shows a positive relationship between the column and the churn rate. Here Age, Balance and Geography_Germany have a positive coorelation which are more likely to churn.
# 
# A negative correlation coefficient close to -1 indicates that as the values of the column increase, the likelihood of the customer 'Exiting' decreases. This suggests a negative relationship between the column and the churn rate.Here,IsActiveMember and Gender_Male is close to -1 and it is negatively correlated and means that they are less likely to churn.
# 
# Correlation coefficients close to 0 indicate a weak or no linear relationship between the column and the 'Exited' variable. Here, CreditScore, Tenure, NumOforoducts and Geography_spain are close to 0 which has no correlation between the 'exited' variable.

# Splitting the dataset
A_train, A_test, B_train, B_test = train_test_split(A, B, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=B)


# Data splitting involves dividing the dataset into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing. This ensures that our model is trained on one set of data, validated on another, and evaluated on another set of data it has never seen before. This helps estimate the model's performance on new, unseen data.random_state allows to reproduce the same random behavior every time when we run our code.  Here stratify is used to enforce the same class balance on the train and test data as the original data.

# Feature scaling is a preprocessing technique used  to standardize or normalize the range of independent variables (features) in our dataset. Scaling ensures that all features have similar magnitudes,  It is vital to perform Feature scaling where all the variables are brought to a similar scale, as the features with high value range dominates in calculating the distances between data.

# LogisticRegression class was imported from scikit-learn and created an instance called logis. The .fit trains the logistic regression model (logis) using the training data where A_train for features and B_train for target variables. The trained logistic regression model make predictions on the test data which is A_test. The predicted labels for the test set are stored in the B_pred.

# Handling class imbalance is an important step, where one class (churned) might be significantly less frequent than the other (not churned).Beacuse of the imbalanced dataset, we are performing the performance metircs and there is a high difference in the performance of the logistic regression model. From the results, we can infer that, Logistic Regression model with an imbalance dataset predicted a biased model tending to predict the majority class more accurately while neglecting the minority class. The model did not learn the underlying patterns of the minority class, resulting in poor generalization. There is a high accuracy of 0.80 and precison of 0.58, recall of 0.18 which is very low and fi score of 0.28 which is again very low. It is crucial to apply resampling techniques to handle this imbalance.

# Random Forest achieved the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.93, indicating strong discriminatory power and effective separation of classes. It also demonstrated balanced precision of 0.81 and recall of 0.90, resulting in a high F1-score of 0.85 and accuracy with 0.85. While Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machine performed well, Random Forest consistently outperformed other models in terms of multiple metrics, making it a strong qualifier. K-Nearest Neighbors showed high recall of 0.85 but comparatively lower precision and F1-score, suggesting potential room for improvement. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree exhibited reasonable performance but were outperformed by Random Forest in various metrics.

#  100 trials were executed, each taking approximately 8 minutes.The "best accuracy: -0.8535" signifies that the optimization aimed to minimize the negative of a metric, in this case, the objective function representing accuracy."Best Hyperparameters: {'max_depth': 40.0, 'min_samples_split': 2.0, 'n_estimators': 50.0}". These optimal hyperparameters were determined through Bayesian optimization, where a max depth of 40, minimum samples split of 2, and 50 estimators yielded the best accuracy.
